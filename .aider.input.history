The app must be divided into a top 60% Composition Window (the terminal) and a bottom 40% Control Area. The Control Area must contain four input buttons (labeled with coding-related symbols) and one Execute button. When any of the four input buttons are clicked, they will only append their designated symbol to the Composition Window. These symbols correspond to four beat types: Kick/Bass Drum, Snare/Rhythm, Hi-Hat/Effect, and a Reset/Clear symbol. The Reset button should clear all content from the terminal but not play any sound upon click. The critical new element is the Execute Button: when this button is clicked, the app must sequentially read the symbols currently displayed in the Composition Window and play the corresponding beat for each symbol in order, creating the composed sequence.

+
+Height Fix: The Composition Window must be a large, fixed-height area (60% of viewport height) with a scrollbar if the content exceeds the height.
+
+Text Style Fix: Crucially, enforce a standard monospace font for all text within the Composition Window to prevent stretching and align the characters cleanly, maintaining the CMD/Terminal look.

+Visual Fixes:
+
+Enforce 100% Height/Width: Adjust the main container to ensure it takes up the full viewport height (h-screen).
+
+Improve Terminal Aesthetic: Change the button styles to use a solid emerald border and a truly dark background to emphasize the CMD look.
+
+Audio Fixes (Highest Priority):
+
+Kick Beat URL Tweak: I will revert the Kick URL one last time to a highly common and reliable drum machine sample that is less likely to have encoding or CORS issues: https://s3.amazonaws.com/freecodecamp/drums/RP4_KICK_1.mp3.
+
+Pre-Play Strategy: I will add a pre-play function linked to the first user click ({, ;, //) to initialize all audio contexts. This is a common pattern to bypass mobile/browser restrictions that prevent audio from playing unless a direct user action triggers it first.

+Mini-App UI/UX and Beat Control Feature Update SpecificationThe goal of this update is to streamline the control panel, optimize button visibility, and introduce a crucial looping feature for beat playback.1.

The controls should be visible immediately upon loading the app, eliminating the need to scroll down.

+Terminal Input Looping Specification1. Feature GoalImplement a mechanism within the terminal interface that recognizes the period (.) character as a special command to automatically loop the immediately preceding complete input string (the "sentence").2. Implementation DetailsElementSpecificationExampleTrigger CharacterThe period (.).The user types Hello World and presses Enter. Then, they type ..Target InputThe entire command or text entered by the user just before the current input.In the example, the target input is Hello World.Loop ActionWhen the user inputs the period (.) and executes the command, the system must re-execute or re-print the Target Input.If the user inputs . after Hello World, the system outputs Hello World again.Loop TerminationThe loop should execute once per period input, mimicking a "repeat last command" shortcut.If the user wants to loop it $N$ times, they must enter $N$ periods, or a numerical loop command must be introduced (e.g., .3 for 3 times).

+The Control Button Interface Redesign requires three main adjustments for improved user experience. First, the existing "Run" or "Play" text label must be replaced with a standard "Resume" or "Play" logo, specifically a clear, universally recognized right-pointing triangle (▶️) icon. Second, all interactive controls (including Play, Stop, and Loop) need a fixed, consistent, medium size (e.g., 40 text px by 40 text px to avoid being visually oversized and to ensure a clean layout. Finally, to eliminate the need for scrolling, the entire set of main beat control buttons must be positioned within a fixed-position header or toolbar at the top of the screen, making them immediately visible upon application load.
