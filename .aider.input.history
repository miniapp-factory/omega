+Code the following app

+music mini-app idea—a modular, click-to-combine beat machine.
+
+This concept is ideal for Base because the low transaction fees allow for frequent, low-cost "mix and mint" actions, and the output (the combined beat) can be instantly minted as an onchain asset.

+"Code Composer"a music game that has buttons that when it is clicked it will play a certain beat and when another button is clicked it will play another beat and will combine to the first button/beat so on and so forth:
+
+The Foundation (Kick/Bass) - A deep, solid, rhythmic thump that sets the pace—like a core library or main loop. - (Button Labels/Logo Function, Core Loop, Main Thread)
+
+
+
+The Action (Snare/Rhythm) - A crisp, medium-pitched sound that provides the driving rhythm—like executing a command. -(Button Labels/Logo Execute, Run Test, Push Commit)
+
+
+
+The Accessory (Hi-Hat/Effect) - A light, rapid, high-pitched effect that adds detail and texture—like a small, frequent action or notification. - (Button Labels/Logo Console.log, Error Beep, Save File)
+
+
+
+The Control - A sound that changes the current state or clears everything. - (Button Labels/Logo Debugger (to pause), Reset (to clear the mix))
+
+
+
+the app looks like a terminal window (dark background, light green/white monospace text) or a circuit board (green/gold lines, glowing lights).
