The changes you need to make involve:

1. Updating the app metadata in `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` (title and description).  
2. Creating or updating the logo generation file `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo`.

Please add the following files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

- `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts`
- `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` (if it does not already exist)
